1) Difference Between DynamoDB and Mysql
      
              DynamoDB is a NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It stores data as key-value pairs in a schema-less way which allows for flexibility as there are no requirements for a fixed table schema. MySQL, on the other hand, is a relational database (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL).

Example Dynamo db

{
    "id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
Example Mysql

CREATE TABLE Users (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

2) Difference between function and stored procedure

Following are the main differences between functions and procedures:
Functions	Procedures
A function has a return type and returns a value.	A procedure does not have a 
return type. But it returns values 
using the OUT parameters.
You cannot use a function with Data Manipulation queries. Only Select queries are allowed in functions.	You can use DML queries such as insert, update, select etc… 
with procedures.
A function does not allow output parameters	A procedure allows both input 
and output parameters.
You cannot manage transactions inside a function.	You can manage transactions
 inside a procedure.
You cannot call stored procedures from a function	You can call a function from a 
stored procedure.
You can call a function using a select statement.	You cannot call a procedure 
using select statements.


3)What is Constructor and its type c#

A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's state and perform any necessary setup operations. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type.

Types of constructor :

●	Default Constructor
●	Parameterized Constructor
●	Copy Constructor
●	Static Constructor
●	Private Constructor 


public class DefaultConstructorExample
{
    // Default constructor
    public DefaultConstructorExample()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Default constructor ");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Creating an object with the default constructor
        DefaultConstructorExample obj = new DefaultConstructorExample();
    }
}

Parameterized Constructor

A parameterized constructor allows you to initialize the object with specific values at the time of creation.
	
	public class DefaultConstructorExample
{
    public DefaultConstructorExample(String Name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Name);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
    
        DefaultConstructorExample obj = new DefaultConstructorExample("dotnet");
    }
}

9)  session in .net:

In C#, a session is typically associated with web applications and is used to store user-specific information across multiple requests. 
The Session object is part of the System.Web namespace and is available in ASP.NET applications. 
It provides a way to store and retrieve values on a per-user basis.12) mvc

Model: Manages data and business logic.
View: Handles the user interface and presentation.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary, managing user input and updating the model and view accordingly.
           used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.
